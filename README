my tiny lighttpd management scripts

they manage simple vhosts, with per-vhost configs and php-cgi sockets.

TODO:
* don't hardcode locations
* django and rails sockets
* spawn fastcgi process
* integrate with init scripts

INSTALL:
 - cp -R addvhost.sh listvhosts.sh skel /your/simple/vhost/path
 - edit addvhost.sh and listvhosts.sh, use /your/simple/vhost/path
 - add the following to your lighttpd.conf: include_shell "sh /your/simple/vhost/path/listvhosts.sh"
 - edit skel/lighty.conf.in with some sensible defaults

USAGE:
cd /your/simple/vhost/path && ./addvhost.sh <hostname>
 - copies skel, parses infiles with sed and sets hostname


listvhosts.sh is used only from inside lighttpd.conf
